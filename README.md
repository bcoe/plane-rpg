Plane-RPG
--------

Foundima is an RPG based in the Mission District of San Francisco. Can you overcome adversity, develop an idea, build a startup, and make millions?

I wrote this RPG (without Internet) while flying from San Francisco to Toronto. No chanages have been made since landing.

Why?
====

A few years ago I built a Tetris game while on a plane from Toronto to San Francisco, I wanted to take on a similar personal challenge.

I hope that it inspires other fun, random, hacking sessions.
